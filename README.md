# PostgreSQL play project

This is a small project using [The Complete Python/PostgreSQL Course 2.0](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-postgresql-database-course/) from [Jose Salvatierra](https://www.teclado.com/).

This code was migrated over from an SQLite project, with a few things changed.

I'm using [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/) as my cloud database.

To use, just git clone, create a PostgreSQL db and rename the '.env.example' file '.env' and add your db url direct after the '=' sign (not as a string).
